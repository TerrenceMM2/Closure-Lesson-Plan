  <h1>Closure Activity #6 - Closure Loop (STU)</h1>
  <h2>✨Open the console to see the magic!✨</h2>

  <script>

      // 1. Create two arrays - one called favoriteFoods with a list of foods, one empty arr called funcArr.

      // 2. Create a function called foodFunc that takes in a parameter (i) and returns an anonymous function. The anonymous function should console.log a given index of the favoriteFoods array.

      // 3. Create a loop to go through the favoriteFoods array and adds a new instance of the foodFunc function and passes the current index.

      // 4. Create a for loop to iterate through each index in the funcArr array and call each function using an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE).
