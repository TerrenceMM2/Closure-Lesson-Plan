  <h1>Closure Activity #4 - Keep It Private (STU)</h1>
  <h2>✨Open the console to see the magic!✨</h2>

  <script>

    // 1. Create a function called payDay.
    // 2. Create a local variable called acctBalance and set to a positive integer.
    // 3. Create a local function called transaction that takes in a number parameter called "amount". This function will add amount to acctBalance and reassign the value.
    // 4. Return an object that contains functions to withdrawal, deposit, and checks the current balance.
    // 5. Test your closure functions by creating a new, global scope variable called "payPeriod", calling each function, and passing in a positive or negative integer.
