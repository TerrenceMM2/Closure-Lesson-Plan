	<h1>Closure Activity #4 (SOLVED) - Keep It Private (STU)</h1>
	<h2>✨Open the console to see the magic!✨</h2>

	<script>
		// 1. Create a function called payDay.
		payDay = () => {

			// 2. Create a local variable called acctBalance and set to a positive integer.
			let acctBalance = 1000;

			// 3. Create a local function called transaction that takes in a number parameter called "amount". This function will add amount to acctBalance and reassign the value.
			transaction = (amount) => {
				acctBalance += amount;
			}

			// 4. Return an object that contains functions to withdrawal, deposit, and checks the current balance.
			return {
				withdrawal: (num) => {
					transaction(num);
				},
				deposit: (num) => {
					transaction(num);
				},
				balance: () => {
					return acctBalance;
				}
			}
		}

		// 5. Test your closure functions by creating a new, global scope variable called "payPeriod", calling each function, and passing in a positive or negative integer.
		const payPeriod = payDay();
		console.log(`Starting Balance = $${payPeriod.balance()}`);
		payPeriod.withdrawal(-500);
		console.log(`Balance after Rent = $${payPeriod.balance()}`);
		payPeriod.withdrawal(-100);
		console.log(`Balance after Groceries = ${payPeriod.balance()}`);
		payPeriod.withdrawal(-20);
		console.log(`Balance after fuel fill-up = $${payPeriod.balance()}`);
		payPeriod.deposit(200);
		console.log(`Balance after deposit = $${payPeriod.balance()}`);
