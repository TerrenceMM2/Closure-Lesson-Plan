    <h2>✨Open the console to see the magic!✨</h2>

    <script>
        // 1. Define a global scope variable called num1 and assignment a number.
        // 2. Write a function called addition that accepts one parameter called num2.
        // 3. Write and return an anonymous function that takes the global scope num1 variable and the script-level, num2 parameter and console.logs the addition of the two.
        // 4. Outside of the addition function, define a variable called myAdd, assign the addition function, and pass in a number.
        // 5. Call the myAdd function.
        // 6. Verify the closure by using console.dir on the myAdd function.
