  <h1>Closure Activity #2 (SOLVED) - Intro to Closures (STU)</h1>
  <h2>✨Open the console to see the magic!✨</h2>

  <script>
    // 1. Define a global scope variable called num1 and assignment a number.
    const num1 = 2;

    // 2. Write a function called addition that accepts one parameter called num2.
    addition = (num2) => {

      // 3. Write and return an anonymous function that takes the global scope num1 variable and the script-level, num2 parameter and console.logs the addition of the two.
      return () => {
        console.log(num1 + num2);
      }
    }

    // 4. Outside of the addition function, define a variable called myAdd, assign the addition function, and pass in a number.
    const myAdd = addition(3);

    // 5. Call the myAdd function.
    myAdd();

    // 6. Verify the closure by using console.dir on the myAdd function.
    console.dir(myAdd);
