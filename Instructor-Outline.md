# JavaScript Closures

## Overview

You will introduce the student to the concept of Closures in JavaScript.

## Instructor Notes

* With the introduction of closures, we now venture into more abstract programming concepts, namely the concept of private methods and a deeper dive into scoping within JavaScript. Expect students to be a little overwhelmed especially after learning about scope.

* The slides will provide formal definitions, examples, and use cases that the students can refer back to. Also, think back to previous activities and how show how you can refactor them to use closures.

## Learning Objectives

* Understand the importance of closures with regard to data manipulation.
