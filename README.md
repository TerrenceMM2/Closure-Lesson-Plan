# Closure-Lesson-Plan

## Description

This repository contains information and hands-on activities to aid in the learning of closures in JavaScript.

## For Instructors

-   Please review the [`instructor-outline.md`](./instructor-materials/instructor-outline.md) for a suggested timetable and notes about each activity.

-   After coming off the topic of scope, students may feel overwhelmed so go through the content slowly and break-down each activity line by line. It may be helpful to illustrate using `console.log` or diagram the structure of a closure and how it interacts with data a various scope levels.

-   Use the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NsCVuBtyvZMqkGw824RcsK1XctRRw6zaq9BbHKpZsh0/edit?usp=sharing) to introduce and explain the benefits of closures.
