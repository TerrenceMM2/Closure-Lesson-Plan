# JavaScript Closures

## Overview

You will introduce the student to the concept of Closures in JavaScript.

## Instructor Notes

* With the introduction of closures, we now venture into more abstract programming concepts, namely the concept of private methods and a deeper dive into scoping within JavaScript. Expect students to be a little overwhelmed especially after learning about scope.

* The slides will provide formal definitions, examples, and use cases that the students can refer back to. Also, think back to previous activities and how show how you can refactor them to use closures.

## Learning Objectives

* Understand the importance of closures with regard to data manipulation.

## Time Tracker

### 1. Instructor Do: Introduction to Closures - 5 min.

* Give a gentle warning that the upcoming content is going to seem a bit odd at first but stress that it is a very important concept in the world of JavaScript programming. Students should understand the concept of scope from the previous activity.

* Go through the accompanying [slide deck]().

### 2. Instructor Do: Activity #1 - Intro to Closures - 5 min.

* You are going to show the students a working example of a closure.

* Use Chrome's DevTools to shows that the browser categorizes the inner function as a "closure." Remember to use `console.dir()`.

### 3. Students Do: Activity #2 - Intro to Closures - 15 min.

* Students will create a simple closure function to add two numbers - one global, one local - and output them to the console.

* Encourage them to use the previous activity, use `console.log` while building and test their function, and work any errors output to the browser console.

### 4. Instructor Do: Activity #3 - Keep It Private - 5 min.

* You are going to demonstrate how to keep an object's variables and methods private but still allow for outside interaction.

* Inform the student that this is an important concept in object oriented programming and that you will circle back to this topic in the future.

### 5. Students Do: Activity #4 - Keep It Private - 15 min.

### 6. Instructor Do: Activity #5 - Closure Loop - 5 min.

* A common way to loop through data is
